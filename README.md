# Dev Charan Sai P

Innovative and research-oriented Computer Science undergraduate with a strong focus on AI and deep learning. I have hands-on experience building AI and deep learning models using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. My expertise includes leading AI research projects, deploying scalable solutions in collaborative environments, and working with Python, data science, and distributed learning, particularly in healthcare and real-time systems.

I am proficient in building Proofs of Concept (PoCs), refactoring legacy code, and deploying AI models across cloud platforms like Google Cloud and IBM Cloud. I am also familiar with federated learning, foundation models, and Generative AI trends. I am passionate about leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for innovation in code generation and transformation, with a solid foundation in both academic and patent-driven AI development.
